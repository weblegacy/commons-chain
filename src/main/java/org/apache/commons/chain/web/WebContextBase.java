/**
 * Abstract base implementation of {@link org.apache.commons.chain.Context} that
 * provides web based applications that use it a "generic" view of HTTP related
 * requests and responses, without tying the application to a particular underlying
 * Java API (such as servlets). It is expected that a concrete subclass
 * of {@link WebContextBase} for each API (such as
 * {@link org.apache.commons.chain.web.servlet.ServletWebContext})
 * will support adapting that particular API's implementation of request
 * and response objects into this generic framework.
 *
 * <p>The characteristics of a web request/response are made visible via
 * a series of JavaBeans properties (and mapped to read-only attributes
 * of the same name, as supported by {@link ContextBase}.</p>
